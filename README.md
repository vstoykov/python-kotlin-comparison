# Comparison of Python and Kotlin

This is a sample project to compare Python with Django and Kotlin with Spring.
As a base is used the Django tutorial https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/

This code was used as part of the presentation done by me at 
[Python Meetup @ Sofia, March Edition](https://www.meetup.com/sofia-python-meetup-group/events/306571041/)
